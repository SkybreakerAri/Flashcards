        <div id="intro">Hey there! Many might see Japanese as a difficult language, and while, certainly, it is different, I love it because it is incredibly straight-forward, rigid, and beautiful. Kanji (漢字), for one, the complicated characters that orginated from China are often dialed up in complexity far more than they need to be. Often, context clues will tell you exactly how the character needs to be pronounced. Better than that, though, is the fact that the kanji each have their own connotation and definition means that you can often deduce the meaning of an unknown word without having to look it up, or even make your own word. The beauty of Japanese. You could compare it to Latin in English, simply with more rules. There are very few exeptions to language, so once you know something, it is applicable across the large marjority of the language, as opposed to the flip-flop nature of English. I'll type more later.
